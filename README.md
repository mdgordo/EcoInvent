# EcoInvent

Building EcoInvent matrices from .spold files

Python

This repository takes the .spold files available from https://v34.ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/File/Files and converts them into an N x N Technology matrix, and an M x N Elemental Flow Matrix used for environmental Life Cycle Analysis calculations. 

Basic Instructions are found in a pdf in the supporting documents. 

There are about 14,000 spold files in xml. These files are only available with an EcoInvent license.
